# 🌟 Hackathon Submission Details

## 💡 Inspiration

The inspiration for Memory Garden came from a deeply personal realization during the summer of 2024. I noticed how quickly precious summer memories fade away in our digital age - photos get buried in camera rolls, experiences become forgotten fragments, and the emotional richness of our best moments gets lost in the noise of social media.

I wanted to create something that would honor the psychological importance of memory preservation while connecting it to the natural world. The idea struck me during a walk through a botanical garden: what if our memories could grow and evolve like plants? What if we could create a digital ecosystem where personal stories flourish based on real environmental conditions?

This fusion of psychology, botany, environmental science, and storytelling felt like the perfect way to address a genuine human need while showcasing technical innovation.

- **Botanical Transformation**: Each memory becomes a unique virtual plant based on the user's emotional state (joy→sunflower, peace→lavender, etc.)
- **Environmental Growth**: Plants evolve through 5 growth stages influenced by real-time weather simulation
- **Rarity System**: High-mood memories can unlock rare and legendary plant varieties
- **Garden Ecosystem**: Creates a personalized digital garden that grows and changes over time

**Advanced Features:**
- **Weather Engine**: 5-factor environmental simulation affecting plant growth
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive insights into memory patterns and emotional trends
