> **Winner Submission for Fusion Hacks 2** - A cross-disciplinary platform that transforms summer memories into a living digital garden through the fusion of psychology, botany, environmental science, and data visualization.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Memory Garden is an innovative web application that revolutionizes how we preserve and interact with our precious summer memories. By combining emotional psychology with botanical science and environmental data, users can plant virtual memories that grow into unique plants based on real-world conditions and personal emotions.

### 🌟 The Innovation

Unlike traditional memory-keeping apps, Memory Garden creates a **living ecosystem** where:
- Memories become virtual plants that evolve over time
- Different emotions manifest as different plant species
- Environmental conditions affect growth patterns
- Personal stories create a unique digital garden landscape
